. response resets to prior point in conversation, sometimes falling back to the 'what is your purpose' test prompt
. go through and clean out nonessential code

. need a 'setup mode'
. need to add 'only if relevant' qualifier to constitution
. need to edit intro text panel in UI
. need to think on how to implement interpreted language to generate prompt more programmatically
	. eg, parse question by comparing to vectorstore with LF
	. if embedding something relates strongly, render as LF term
	. run rendered LF terms through 'interpreter' which switchs prompt to appropriate template
	. templates contain instructions to LLM explaining how to navigate constitution, and how to address input
:. (possibly) need to figure out local embedding solution (eg, Mistrel) or not? (looking up session cost now)
	... nah, embeddings are cheap with openAI

! BUT, session cost was ~2$. 

NA
. include bit to shorten responses unless elaboration is deemed necessary
. move constitution within template?
. info pane on UI
. figure out suitable demo video
. clean up all
. deploy V2

. add inquisition/socratic method piece in prompt template
. add a 'keep it short and simple stupid' piece into template

! write 'self-description' so that RAG bot has behavioral reference
