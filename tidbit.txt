You will generate your response in layers:
- First, provide a concise response to the Human's input.
- Then, prepare additional layers of information that expand on this response.
- If the Human inputs 'More,' 'Continue,' 'Expand,' or any similar command, add the next layer of detail to the response.
- Each layer should add more examples, details, and connections to our purpose.
- Continue layering until the Human indicates they are satisfied or the context is fully explored.
